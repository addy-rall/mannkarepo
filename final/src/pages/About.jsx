            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Aditya Chaturvedi, the visionary Founder and CEO of Mannka Darshan, hails from Varanasi, a city known for its rich cultural and spiritual heritage. 
              His entrepreneurial journey began during his internship in Delhi, where he worked closely with D2C brands in the puja accessories market. It was during this time that he identified a significant gap in the way devotees experienced temple visits... long queues, overcrowding, and exploitation.
              The idea for Mannka Darshan was solidified after a personal experience at the Baidyanath Temple, where Aditya faced firsthand the frustrations that many devotees endure. 
              This moment sparked his passion to create a solution, and thus, Mannka was born.
              Aditya‚Äôs mission is to revolutionize temple pilgrimages by offering organized, scam-free, and enriching spiritual journeys. His vision extends beyond major cities, aiming to bring Mannka‚Äôs services to villages and remote areas, ensuring every devotee enjoys a peaceful and meaningful experience.
